# OpenFF QCSubmit

*An automated framework for contributing quantum chemical datasets to, and retrieving from, QCFractal instances.*

QCSubmit helps to curate and contribute new quantum chemical (QC) datasets to the [QCArchive] (or any other [QCFractal] instance), as well as to retrieve already computed datasets.

[QCFractal]: http://docs.qcarchive.molssi.org/projects/qcfractal/en/latest/
