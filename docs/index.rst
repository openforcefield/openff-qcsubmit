OpenFF QCSubmit
===============

*An automated framework for contributing quantum chemical datasets to, and retrieving from, QCFractal instances.*

The main purpose of the ``openff-qcsubmit`` is to facilitate curating and contributing new quantum chemical (QC)
datasets to the `QCArchive <https://qcarchive.molssi.org/>`_ (or any other `QCFractal <http://docs.qcarchive.molssi.org/projects/qcfractal/en/latest/>`_
instance), as well as to retrieve already computed datasets.

.. warning:: ``openff-qcsubmit`` is still pre-alpha. It is not fully tested and the API is still in flux.
